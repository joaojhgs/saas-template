# Codebase convetions and enforced rules

All files inside the [server](/src/server/) folder should have the `'use server'` directive on top, as them will only be served to the backend and callable from the front end.

Branch names should follow this convention:
`^((hotfix|bugfix|fix|feature|improvement|chore|style|refactor)\/[a-zA-Z0-9_\-]+)|(main)$`.

Ex: `hotfix-auth-component` | `feature-schedulling` | `main`

Commit messages should follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) naming style. You can also use `pnpm commit` for a cli interface for commit naming.

Files and folders in general should follow the `kebab-case` name convention, only react `.tsx` files inside the `components` folder should follow the `SnakeCase` naming convetion.

## Run 

Node version: 20.9.0

Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation), if it is not installed yet.

Install dependencies:
```
pnpm install
```

Init supabase with:
```
pnpm supabase start
```

Replace the environment variables with the correct data after supabase finishes starting.

Run dev mode: 
```
pnpm dev
```

The Supabase Studio will run at: [http://127.0.0.1:54323/](http://127.0.0.1:54323/)

The frontend will run at: [http://127.0.0.1:3000/](http://127.0.0.1:54323/)

A default admin use will be created to be used on the application:
